 lbuffer - a mutable string support to lua
===========================================

lbuffer is a C module for lua, it provides mutable string feature to
lua language[1]. it has all routines from lua's string module, except
pattern match, reverse and byte-code dump. and add several modify
functions. it provides:
    * change the value of buffer without copy it.
    * a pair of full feature pack/unpack functions.
    * get a subbuffer from the origial buffer, and the changes to
      subbufer will affects origial buffer.

install
=======

compile it just like other lua module. in *nix, just:
gcc -shared -obuffer.so *.c -llua51

and in Windows using MinGW, just:
gcc -mdll -DLUA_BUILD_AS_DLL -I/path/to/lua/include *.c /path/to/lua51.dll -o buffer.dll

and in Windows using MSVC, just create a Win32/DLL Project, and add
all .c and .h files to project, set output name to buffer.dll and
compile it.

if you want subbuffer feature, you need define a macro named
LB_SUBBUFFER, because subbuffer will slow the memory realloc function
in *all* buffers.

example
=======

-- main usage see test.lua
require 'buffer'
local b = buffer "hello"
b:append "world"
b:sub(6,5):assign " "
assert(b :eq "hello world")
